- the background of the TBar, which is defined by MyStyle and state of the bar - there are two MyStyles assigned to each TBar - one
for focused and one for unfocused state.

Tiles could be static icons ( cannot be pressed );
blocks of buttons - each having two shapes - pressed and normal;
Text labels; Empty space tiles.
There could be upto 256 tiles, each residing on one of the cells in 8x8 grid. 
Several tiles could reside in single cell, in  which case they get superimposed on top of each other.

- bevel of the TBar. When TBar is rendered all of its tiles are superimposed on top of its background, and resulting image will have a 3D bevel drawn on it, using colors from same MyStyle as used for background. 
Bevel could be switched off partially or entirely. 
Respective configuration options has been added where appropriate. 
When TBar is pressed - its bevel is inverted.
