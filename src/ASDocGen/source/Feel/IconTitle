	<listitem>
		<para>Specifies  that  a  title should be displayed under an iconified
		app.  The colors used are the ForeColor  and  BackColor  of  the
		ButtonTitleFocus in the look.name file. Note: less space is left
		for the app's icon, so it will be resized  acordingly.   Only  a
		portion of the icon title will be displayed until the icon gains
		focus, and then the title "box" will expand to reveal  the  win-
		dow's entire name.</para>
