		<para>Some applications (notably xv) have been designed without reading widely
        accepted and used standards such as ICCCM. Gravity value is one of
        the hints that often get misplaced by applications. As the result may
        exhibit weird placement behaviour - such as windows moving to the
        top-left with each resize or file opened. Try specifying StaticGravity
        for such apps. Also some applications do not set gravity correctly. For
        example you start an application with geometry +10-10 which means
        SouthWestGravity and that should fix position of left and bottom sides
        of the window. But window set its gravity to NorthWestGravity instead
        and as the result window gets placed further down to the bottom by the
        size of the framne decorations. In this cases you can specify whatever
        gravity you want and thus override those stupid apps.
