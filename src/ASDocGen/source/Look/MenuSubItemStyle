		<para>AfterStep now includes this new feature: when you select
		an item from the menu - this item will be marked as recently used,
		and next time the menu is opened it will show all the recently used
		items from its SUBMENU. For exmaple you do :
</para><para>
		Menu->Applications->rxvt
</para><para>
		Next time you open the Main menu, it will display rxvt just under
		the "Applications" item with some offset.
</para><para>
		It looks much better when this subitems are shown with
		different (smaller ) font. To achive that - specify a MyStyle
		with asmaller font using the MenuSubItemStyle option in your look
		file.
</para><para>
		This feature could be turned off or altered by using the
		RecentSubmenuItems option in your feel file: set it to 0 to
		disable this feature.</para>
