<section><title>1.2. What is AfterStep?</title>
<para>
AfterStep is a Window Manager for the X Window System (hereafter referred to as X).
It was started to emulate the look and feel of NeXTSTEP(tm), but has evolved into
something that while still being able to emulate NeXT, can do much much more.  Without
using much memory or cpu time, AfterStep provides all the features one could want in a
Window Manager.
</para>

<section><title>1.3. What is AfterStep's history?</title>
<para>
Original AfterStep was a continuation of the BowMan Window Manager which was originally put together by Bo Yang.  
BowMan was based on the fvwm Window Manager, written by Robert Nation. Fvwm was based on code from twm. 
And so on....
</para><para>
Idea was to emulate some of the look and feel of the NEXTSTEP(tm) user interface, but overtime it evolved to include other concepts, as dictated by end user needs. 
It is that unholy direction that made Alfredo Kojima abandon project in 1997 and create a Window Manger of its own - 
Window Maker, which had a goal of strict adherance to NEXTSTEP interface ideas.
</para><para>
After releasing version 1.8.11 it became aparent for developers that old AfterStep codebase had reached its limits and 
required a substantial redesign. Such redesign began with development of radically new image handling library 
libAfterImage, introducing high quality image manipulation, blending, TrueType fonts, XML image scripting, and more.
Building off of libAfterImage and incorporating new developments in X Window management, AfterStep 2.0 was born and released in
September, 2004. As of now AfterStep code base contains none of the original fvwm parts, and association to fvwm, twm and BowMan remain only in history.

<section><title>1.4. Fine, what if I'm not running AfterStep 2.0? Is there a FAQ for me?</title>
<para>
Yes.  There should be a version of the AfterStep FAQ available within your specific AfterStep distribution.
If you are using a version earlier than 2.0, it is strongly suggested you upgrade.

<section><title>1.5. What is X? What are these "window managers" ?</title>
<para>
"X" is shorthand for The X Window System. It is a basis for building graphical user
interfaces for UNIX (it is available for non-UNIX systems, but wasn't designed to be as
such). "X" is not the interface itself, just a foundation for one.  For more information,
check <ulink url="http://www.x.org/">www.x.org</ulink>.
</para><para>
A Window Manager is a program that manages your windows during your X session. AfterStep
is one of many available <ulink url="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/">window managers</ulink>.
