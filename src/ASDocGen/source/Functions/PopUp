 <term>PopUp <emphasis remap='I'>"popup_name"</emphasis></term>
 <listitem>
    <para>There are two situations where this might occur; as a popup menu stanza
    definition, or in calling a previously defined menu declaration.</para>

    <literallayout remap='.nf'>
    Popup <emphasis remap='I'>"popup_name"</emphasis>
    built-in_command  <emphasis remap='I'>"name"</emphasis> [<emphasis remap='I'>argument</emphasis>]
    EndPopup
    </literallayout> <!-- .fi -->

    <para>Specfies the definition of a complex menu popup <emphasis remap='I'>"popup_name"</emphasis>, which
    can be bound to a mouse button or key using <emphasis remap='I'>"popup_name"</emphasis> to recall
    this declaration.  <emphasis remap='I'>built-in_command</emphasis> specifies which command will be
    performed, utilizing it's syntax from this list of Built-In
    Commands/Functions. <emphasis remap='I'>"name"</emphasis> specifies the name which will appear
    within the menu for the given item, and additionally any <emphasis remap='I'>arguments</emphasis>
    needed by the <emphasis remap='I'>built-in_command</emphasis>.  The Popup definition ends with the
    keyword EndPopup. Sub-menus can be created by calling the Popup built-in
    within another Popup declaration, as long as that sub-menu was defined
    earlier in the configuration file.</para>

    <para>Shortcut keys may be specified in the menu definition by preceding a
    character with an ampersand. The ampersand will not be displayed, but the
    character after it will be displayed at the right side of the same entry.
    <!--  and if the user presses the corresponding key, then that item will be -->
    <!--  activated as if it had been clicked upon. -->
    Only alphanumeric characters
    may be used as shortcut keys.  The shift state of the keyboard is ignored
    when testing shortcut characters.</para>
    <!--  Shortcut keys are not operative unless MENU_HOTKEYS was defined when -->
    <!--  building AfterStep. If WINDOWLIST_HOTKETS was also defined, then hot -->
    <!--  keys are automatically added to the WindowList when it is displayed. -->

    <para>When calling a previously defined menu or a menu from a key-stroke
    combination, Popup is simply used as a built-in command with the
    <emphasis remap='I'>"name"</emphasis> referring to the previously defined Popup definitions name.</para>

    <para>Popups can be bound to keys through the use of the key modifier. Popups
    can be operated without using the mouse by binding to keys, and operating
    via the up arrow, down arrow, and enter keys.  Refer to the <emphasis remap='I'>feel.name</emphasis>
    files and below in EXAMPLES for examples.</para>
