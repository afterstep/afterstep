This directory contains 7 examples of what libAfterImage can do.
This examples are not built automagically, since most users are not
likely to need these. They are intended for developers primarily.

Here is how to build examples in this directory :

All of the examples require that libAfterImage is built first.
As libAfterImage may utilize libAfterBase, for some of the low level
tasks, it is recommended to build libAfterBase prior to anything
else. After that libAfterImage has to be built and installed.
Both of the above steps can be accomplished by simply doing :

  ./configure ; make ; make install

in respective directory.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MMX NOTICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Note:
libAfterImage gets compiled with inline MMX assembly enabled.
If you have CPU that does not support it - you'll
have to manually turn that off by using --disable-mmx-optimization
option to configure script.
Otherwise you gonna get wierd segfaults and Illigal Instruction
exceptions.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MMX NOTICE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Once both libraries are installed we can proceed to compiling
the examples. Top do that you will need to execute :

  ./configure ; make

in this directory. Easy. That should build all the examples.

If something goes wrong and you need to update your system and
repeat above commands, don't forget to remove config.cache, prior
to running configure script.

All the examples accept command line parameters, and description
of those can be obtained by running example with -h option.
Arguments are not required, and examples should display some
sensible defaults.

This set of examples comes with 3 test images and 1 TTF font
file. Defaults are set to use this files.

Note that you will not be able to see TTF font rendered if you do
not have FreeType library version 2 installed.
