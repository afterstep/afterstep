C++/C CONVENTIONS IN AFTERSTEP

1 Directory structure
2 Naming conventions
3 Methods
4 C/C++ Mixup
5 Documentation


1 DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

(Here, ~ (tilde) refers to the build top dir.)

  ~/afterstep				Configuration
					(later copied to e.g. /usr/share)

  ~/					Scripts and things,               
					helper applications 
					(e.g. docex.pl, which extracts
					descriptions and things)
  					System dependend configuration
					(compile time options)

  ~/lib					Libraries
  ~/lib/as++				Base AfterStep C++ lib
  ~/lib/asw++				AfterStep C++ widget lib
					
  ~/include				Includes, header files from
					~/lib go here

  ~/doc					Documentation 
					(development specific)

  ~/doc/afterdoc			Documentation
					(Afterstep documentation)

  ~/src					The afterstep window manager
					source code + module source codes
					& application source codes


2 NAMING CONVENTIONS

To keep the sources as easy as possible to maintain, every developer should 
stick to these naming conventions (they are meant only for C++).

Methods should be clearly named. This may lead to long names, but makes it
much easier to read! The first word starts with a small letter, next words 
are directly appended with a capital letter, e.g. setGeometry().
(Annotation: This is especially meant for public methods. Hidden methods
of course may be a bit more cryptic.)

Variables (see methods). All words start with small letters and are seperated
by an underscore, e.g. file_name.


3 METHODS

"char *className() const { return "name"; }" must be implemented in
every class.

3.1 templates

Class		Description					Who does it?

3.2 as++ library

Methods		Description					Who does it?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
msec(int)	sleep
usec(int)	sleep
strtok
strtol
strdup


Class		Description					Who does it?

asSysinfo	hostName(), osType()
asDisplay	c++ wrapper for basic X display macros		jsawinsk
asError		methods for errors, warnings and information
		(X compatible)

asDir		sth like ls, sorting, file type etc.
asDirTree	recursive directory tree (public asDir)
asPath		useful methods for paths and files		guylhem
		(should honour wild cards, maybe regexp?)
asModule	module communications
		(use iostream)	
asParser	parser class for configuration files
		(see Xlib option functions)



4 C/C++ Mixup

No hints yet.


5 Documentation

There will a parser that extracts information from header files.
