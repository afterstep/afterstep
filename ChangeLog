   libAfterBase/output.c started working on collor allocation on PseudoColor
   visuals

[2001-06-12: sashav]
 * completed implementation of image alpha beveling. completed implementation
   of image flipping - need some cleanup thou to allow for tiling.

[2001-06-11: sashav]
 * fixed configure to produce correct dependencies
 *  fixed configure to correctly create dependacy info
 * no message
 * Hopefully fixed memory allocations audit on libAfterBase.
 * Added ASImageBevel to allow for transparent bevelling of images while
   merging layers. Hopefully fixed X libs in configure script - need to rerun
   autoconf
 *  added configclean target to the top level makefile; fixed libraries
   makefiles to correctly generate .depend files
 *  fixed configure scripts to not do extra checks when invoked from one
   another

[2001-06-11: owsla]

[2001-06-10: sashav]
 * got rid of old image loading stuff. LoadImageWithMask moved into resources.h
   and is now simple shortcut to libAfterImage loader

[2001-06-09: sashav]
 * made test to compile; Fixed several bugs in libAfterImage; optimized 2bpp
   handling in xpm code; builtin xpm handler is about 2 times as fast as libXpm
   on small images and 5 times on larger ones

[2001-06-08: sashav]
 * configure fixes
 * updated configure scripts
 * further progress - src/test compiles now, but need to redo
   libAfterImage/configure
 * fixed compilation bug in import.c
 * rebuilt configure scripts
 * updated configure scripts to reflect addition of the xpm parsing code
 * Completed custom xpm implementation. Needs to be debugged thou.
 * hopefully fixed main configure script to gracefully handle libraries
   configuration as well. MOved configure.h and some other headers into include
   dir, so it could be used by modules

[2001-06-07: sashav]
 * Fixed MyName requests in selfdiag.c; Added xpm.c to implement custom xpm
   handling code - appears to be rather simple and effective. Most of the
   things are implemented, except for top level routine.
 * cleaned configure script for libafterimage. added afterimage-libs script to
   print list of LD_FLAGS for linking with libafterimage

[2001-06-06: sashav]
 * fixed bug found by allanon when asimage2ximage would produce black ximage
   due to unset flags in scanline

[2001-06-05: sashav]
 * fixed 50% of libAfterStep files to compile. added functions.c to hold all
   the function processing miscelanea cleaned up includes on the way.
 * Aggregated module library code into ASmodule.c  - soon to be renamed into
   module.c. readaspacket.c, Xmodule.c are now gone. Rewritten packet reading
   code to use socket_* interface from libAfterBase, with correct endiannes
   handling of the data - need to fix src/afterstep/module.c too, and maybe
   move some code from there into libAfterStep/module.c.

[2001-06-04: sashav]
 * started documenting libAfterImage
 * fixed bug in configure --with-jpeg
 * added missing .depend
 * sorted out compilation problems, and test now builds with new libAfterImage

[2001-06-04: owsla]
 * updated configure
 * updated the .cvsignore files

[2001-06-03: sashav]
 * got libAfterImage to compile

[2001-06-02: sashav]
 * hopefully resolved libAfterImage dependancy on libAfterBase

[2001-06-01: sashav]
 * separated libAfterImage files from the rest of the crowd
 * started up libAfterImage

[2001-05-31: sashav]
 * forgot to add socket files
 * Implemented libAfterBase/socket.c to perform all the network communication
   stuff. It implements socket setup, buffered writes of int and string data,
   effective protocol implementation for non-blocking reading.
 * fixed configure scripts to correctly compile everything

[2001-05-30: sashav]
 * Prototyped ASRenderer interface
 * completed fixing old lib files to compensate for file relocation. There
   needs to be something done to Mkaefiles and configure to correctly set up
   include paths and libraries.

[2001-05-29: sashav]
 * added output.c to libAfterImage to do all the show_* stuff. added astype.h
   to define all the basic types fixed most of the files to compile
 * post relocation cleanup in process - several things merged together into
   fs.c and os.c
 * updated to reflect location change

[2001-05-28: sashav]
 * Split ASVisual from ScreenInfo and rearranged ARGB32. Added ASGradient to
   asimage.h and made gradient_t to be a synonym to it. That should allow for
   better library independancy - visual will go with libAfterImage while
   ScreenInfo will move into libAfterStep , or, possibly will split up even
   more. Goal is to make libAfterImage completely independant from everything
   else.
 * Created prototype for the new library structure - libAfterBase. There will
   be two more libraries : libAfterImage and libAfterStep. This is to split
   generic and non-generic code and allow for libraries to be used separately
   - as a preparation for libAfterImage release as a stand-alone library.)

[2001-05-23: allanon]
 * Updated FSF snail mail address.

[2001-05-12: sashav]
 * added code to check for valid channels while flipping

[2001-05-10: sashav]
 * Completed gradients drawing code. Started  on flipping code. Added direction
   reverse to output method.

[2001-05-09: sashav]
 * Implemented vertical gradient drawing. sorted out relationship between
   channel numbering and ARGB32 component order - its the same now.
 * fixed mono line encoding to add zero terminator at the end; fixed scanline
   back_color initialization to have alpha at 0xFF; fixed decoration layouting
   to not use stack memory in linked list; fixed property event handler to
   initialize variable to NULL; Afterstep now starts , althou does not do
   anything usefull

[2001-05-08: sashav]
 * coded gradients drawing using ASImages with smoothing and dithering - works
   very blasted fast. Fixed numerous include's issues

[2001-05-07: sashav]
 * fixed create_screen_window for InputOnly windows fixed bug in screen
   initialization where Colormap ID would get lost fixed bug in desktop
   creation code where desktop->scr would never get initialized. Added
   show_progress function to work similarly to show_warning/error Rearranged
   thresholds for output verbosity Added stdargs.h  to import.c - suggested by
   Sean Dague

[2001-05-04: sashav]
 * completed ASFont implementation as needed at the moment - there will need to
   be some work done in order to adapt it to locale support.( as well as in
   several other places). changed glyph compression algorithm once again to run
   length encode only 0s and FFs, and store rest in raw format. That allows to
   cut down on memory since we don't use 2 bytes anymore. 3 step antialiasing
   works now. Off to image rotation and gradient drawing.

[2001-05-03: sashav]
 * Improved glyph compression algorithm so now it actually reduces size, even
   on ery small fonts. Tryed to implement additional glyph smoothing, but
   something is wrong - disabled for now.

[2001-05-02: sashav]
 * fixed font drawing to group glyphs as close together as possible - make for
   much nicer effect.
 * debugged X11 fonts loading and drawing. Still need to do something about
   negative left bearings - ought to really offset a pen to overlap charcters

[2001-05-01: sashav]
 * Implemented antialiasing for native X  fonts - still needs some debuggin.

[2001-04-30: sashav]
 * added RLE compression to the font glyph cache. added character range
   specification for the font. added right-to-left writing order on per font
   basis.

[2001-04-27: sashav]
 * implemented text drawing using precached TTF fonts -- needs addition of
   locale support in future. Fixed image merging to do clipping correctly.
   Added image background color
 * fixed freetype headers problems and a bug in font hashing

[2001-04-26: sashav]
 * started implementing font manager and freetype support

[2001-04-25: sashav]
 * moved scanline merging functions into separate file
 * fixed most blending function so not to tresspass alpha channel boundaries.
   Added tint_scanlines and implemented dissipation
 * fixed bug in image loading where piexls would get shifted by one to the
   right. added 14 image blending functions - almost matching that of the
   GIMP's capabilities, except for multiply and divide modes, which I don't see
   much sense in. Added RGB->HSV->RGB and RGB->HLS->RGB conversion functions.

[2001-04-24: sashav]
 * cleaned up output/encoding functionality. Added quality parameters to
   dynamically adjust quality on per image basis. Implemented alpha blending
   and generic layer merging framework.

[2001-04-23: sashav]
 * debugged tiling functionality and optimized it so not to do repeated
   compression on the same data. Added compression ratio specification on per
   image basis. OPtimized buffer copy to use 32bit data transfer. Implemented
   tinting( as a part of tiling process ).
 * debugging tiler

[2001-04-22: sashav]
 * added tile_image() - needs debugging
 * ASImageDecoder

[2001-04-20: sashav]
 * added TIFF import and implemented generic image loading function with search
   capabilities and subimage loading. Fixed two more bugs in image scaling.
 * added GIF import filter; added configure code to detect gif and tiff
   libraries

[2001-04-19: sashav]
 * .CUR is the same as .ICO only type = 2
 * Added support for .PNM, .PPM, .ICO, .BMP image file formats - TIFF and GIF
   to go

[2001-04-18: sashav]
 * xcf image loading now works, but only gets you first layer with the same
   size as whole image. Need to implement layers merging for ASImages to get
   complete support for GIMP's xcf files
 * fixed bug in xcf channel loading - theer are no such thing as channel type

[2001-04-17: sashav]
 * most of the preparation work for xcf reading is done - now off to actually
   create ASImage from it. added code to poupulate ASScanline with 0's where
   data is not available;

[2001-04-16: sashav]
 *  minor quality tweaks in rations 1-2 scaling up. Started implementing
   ASImageDecoder for automatic tinting/tiling
 * IMplemented JPEG input filter for ASImage. Fixed long standing bug in image
   scaling causing wierdness in scaling UP with small ratios. Started
   implemntation of XCF file reader.

[2001-04-15: sashav]
 * implemented png file reader and fixed blatant bug in scale image up where
   first line got garbadge in it

[2001-04-14: sashav]

[2001-04-13: sashav]
 * compilation fixes
 * Implemented xpm loading into asimage. Updated asimage to correctly use
   ScreenInfo. implemented create_screen_pixmap and create_screen_ximage
 * fixed test abit to not spit lots of warnings

[2001-04-12: sashav]
 * converted asfeel, backgrounds, mywidget, and others to use ScreenInfo.
   libafterstep and libasGUI now compiles clean, althou libasGUI will need to
   be cleaned up to use ASImage for most of the stuff instead of old pixmap
   based drawing.

[2001-04-11: sashav]
 * converted mytexture.c to be multyscreen aware - althou when ASImage is done
   that will have to be switched to use ASImages instead of all the funky
   Pixmap stuff. GetColor is no longer needed, GetShadow and GetHilite moved to
   mystyles.c - get rid of lib/getcolor.c

[2001-04-10: sashav]
 * multihead support work in progress - colors are internally stored as 32bit
   ARGB values. and converted to pixels based on each screen - need to add GC
   creation code to ScreenInfo code. parse_argb_color is implemented and should
   be used instead of XParseColor.

[2001-04-08: sashav]
 * fixed bugs in scaling down code with ratio > 2; It appears that you can
   create windows with different visual only if you create new colormap and
   allocate border color from it as well. Fixed screen.c accordingly. We keep
   black and white pixels and colormap in ScreenInfo now - should use it
   instead of X macros

[2001-04-06: sashav]
 * implemented workaround for some stupid X servers that denys you your
   constitutional right to use whatever Visual you like.
 * couple bugfixes for new visual handling code. moved ximage->scanline->ximage
   code from asimage.c to screen.c still need to implement PseudoClor handling
 * hopefully fixed bug in 2x scaling up code

[2001-04-05: sashav]
 * no message
 * reworked ScreenInfo abit to include visual info. Added screen.c to
   libafterstep to collect together all the Screen/display related stuff -
   ConnectX, MyXErrorHandle, and several new things : init_screen and
   destroy_screen. nolock_mods has been moved outside of the ScreenInfo as it
   is per-display and not per-screen stuff. all_screens global variable holds
   pointers to all ScreenInfo structrures for available screens. Added
   query_visual_info to try and obtain best possible visual for AfterStep to
   use. Need to move ximage->as->ximage conversion stuff into screen.c.
   ConnectX now takes only one parameter - pointer to ScreenInfo is
   discontinued
 * same old Ximage cleanup

[2001-04-04: sashav]
 * asimage->ximage debugging again - this time about 50% performance increase.
 * more optimization to ximage output algorithm - that was the last of it I'm
   sick and tired from this stuff

[2001-04-03: sashav]
 * Some tweaks to XImage writing code to speed things up - we were spending
   upto 30% of time writing XImages - unacceptable.
 * fixed bug in line interpolation causing stripy artifacts in scaling up
 * fixed bug in line interpolation causing stripy artifacts in scaling up
 * mmx debugged

[2001-04-02: sashav]
 * Added some MMX inline assembly to image scaling code to hopefully make it
   faster -  need to verify if that indeed is the case.
 * fix to mystyle drawing as applyed to empty menu drawing
 * aaa

[2001-04-01: sashav]
 * scaling speed optimizations

[2001-03-31: sashav]
 * debugged new scaling code - scale up is rather nice even with huge ratio -
   check out src/test

[2001-03-30: sashav]
 * Implemented complete scaling Up procedure for arbitrary ratio - if it'll
   work then similar stuff will go for 1-2 and 2-3 ratios. Added
   reshape_winlist to WinList to actually generate layout of titlebars based on
   WinList data and store pointers to them in appropriate place in WMDecor
   structures. It now needs to be debugged as a prototype for other modules.
 * debugged scaling down algorithm  - it now works and scale things down rather
   nicely. Thus we have a proof of concept and can proceed on to scaling up -
   which is mopstly implemented already

[2001-03-29: sashav]
 * completed implementation of scaling down of ASImages. Added dithering
   capabilities to ASImage->XImage conversion to hopefully produce better
   results on 16bpp and 15bpp Fixed bug in ASWinLIst message processing to
   create WinList if it did not exist. Fixed Bug in afterstep to initialize
   handlers in main window list to correct functions.
 * defined structure of high level scaling API

[2001-03-28: sashav]
 * Added AS message reading/partiall handling to new WinList. Moved
   get_window_* functions into aswinlist.c Changed the way process_message is
   called - it now takes ASMessage * as a param. Made everything compiling.
 * some theory investigation into up scaling algorithms with smoothing

[2001-03-27: sashav]
 * the best variant of compression algorithm - average compression ratio is
   about 75for highly random images(nature) and 30for regular images (naked
   body, etc.); no off to more exciting things

[2001-03-26: sashav]
 * no message
 * fixed compression code

[2001-03-24: owsla]
 * removed static keyword from libasimage_decode_line, this was preventing it
   from being exported in the lib, which made the test program fail

[2001-03-23: sashav]
 * optimized asimage decompression algorithm scaling down algorithm
   implemented/.
 * extensive asimage debugging - compression now seems to work fine

[2001-03-22: sashav]
 * Completed implementation of Pixmap->ASImage->Pixmap cycle Now off to
   debugging and implementing of scaling/alpha-blending/etc.
 * added timeouts to asetroot for displaying window; added flush_wmprops_data
   to remove specifyed properties - updated asetroot to use it. fixed rather
   nasty bug in asvector causing memory corruption in modules code; Fixed error
   handling in LoadImage

[2001-03-21: sashav]
 * Fixed module connection code to corrently use WMProps to get socket
   filename. Fixed afterstep initialization to setup modules only after WMProps
   initialized.
 * Updated asetroot to use ASWMProps for background property reading/writing.
   Added even handler to wmprops.c to handle property change events for root
   and selection windows - need to do the same for client properties as well (
   maybe?) . Added set_as_background to wmprops.c for asetroot to use. Added
   set_client_names and set_client_hints to clientprops.c for use by modules.
   Added set_text_property to facilitate conversion into UTF8 of text
   properties where needed. Added encode_atom_list to allow for easy
   translation from bitset into atom list. Updated asetroot to use new
   set_client_* functions for hints. ( it now is Extended WM specs compliant as
   needed).

[2001-03-20: sashav]
 * Fixed Cursor grabbing code to use correct cursor IDs. Fixed auditing code to
   not count memory cached in freed pool. Added destruction code for LayoutDef.
   Fixed default DecorLayouts to put things in the right places. Numerous fixes
   in LayoutDef generation code. Window decorations seems to be correct now.
   Added checks to several places in mystyles to check for non-zero pixmap
   size. There still is wierd bug in menuwindow causing X errors on menu close.
 * fixed several memory corruption bugs in myicon_create, mylook_init and
   ashash. Added flush_ashash_memory_pool to free up memory so that audit shows
   relevant data. added cleanup_mode to audit to disable invalid opointer
   reports (if needed)

[2001-03-19: sashav]
 * hmm, catching bugs in new layout code - making progress - AS now segfaults
   due to some obscure memory corruption. :)

[2001-03-13: sashav]
 * Improved owsla's fix to counter bug - xdestroyimage should not really be
   deallocating NULL memory

[2001-03-11: owsla]
 * Fixed bug that caused Total deallocs to be higher than Total allocs, this
   happened because count_find_and_extract() did not have an alternative if
   remove_hash_item() failed.
 * Added a pretty line break in spool_unfreed_mem()

[2001-03-08: sashav]
 * no message

[2001-03-06: sashav]
 * almost done with ornament layout generation code - smaller part of frame
   layout left. reverted ASHashKey back to unsigned short - when it was changed
   to unsigned int - no idea.

[2001-02-22: sashav]
 * Fixed crashing bugs in aswindow.c(restack_window()) and Xmodule.c(
   My_XErrorHandler()) Standardized titlebar resizing/respacing functions and
   now use it in both WMIcon and WMDecor. Fixed icons being black on second
   inocification - needed to resize layouts in fix_icon_size. Icon title now is
   drawn not smaller then icon itself.

[2001-02-15: sashav]
 * Completed implementation of function validation in asfeel.c; Fixed cursor
   grabbing in ExecuteComplexFunction to use actuall cursor ID instead on
   number. Supposedly got icon mapping/unmapping right this time.
   Iconification/deiconification actually works now, but fails on reentry -
   i.e. iconify->deiconify->iconify - needs some more debugging. Fixed memory
   corruption in winlist menu.

[2001-02-14: sashav]
 * playing with mywmicon and widgets. Implmented event bubbling up to higher
   level widgets if not handled by a widget. Implemented some memory
   conservation when allocating memory for MyLayourElems. Implemented memory
   preallocation caching for ASHashItem.

[2001-02-01: sashav]
 * extensive debugging of window initial mapping and subsequent withdrawal.
   Windows are now decorated and destroyed correctly. Multiple reparenting/
   messaging/destruction bugs fixed. Placement fixed when window is decorated
   after AS startup and is using USPosition. Menus needs some debugging.
 * event debugging

[2001-01-30: sashav]
 * Added mystrdup/mystrndup to memory audit code, since they are so generic;
   Fixed memory leaks in asdatabase.c(match_list), Feel.c(key binding and
   EdgeScroll), CaptureAllWindows (read_32prop_list), few other places.
   Implemented cleanup procedures for all the static data (aswindows.c,
   clientprops.c, modules.c, wmprops.c,mystyles.c); Fixed workspace session
   saving code to correctly recognize and workaround geometry. AfterSTep has no
   visible memory leaks as of now.

[2001-01-29: sashav]
 * removed config reading from the pipe - was causing some compile time
   problems, and updated README.nl
 * Changed memory audit to use hash tables instead of linked list - its blazing
   fast now. Added add_hash_item to memory audit recognizeable functions -
   makes it much more usefull. Need to do the same for strdup functions.

[2001-01-28: sashav]
 * Drawing in spaces between titlebar and client is fixed - new option
   BorderColor has to be added to MyStyles. Several memory leaks fixed - in
   menus, destruction of disabled elements in mywidgets, etc.

[2001-01-26: sashav]
 * nailed down this memory corruption bug - VECTOR_TAIL was not working very
   good - forgot to multiply by unit size. Now lets fnd out with this huge
   number of pipes in linux 2.4 - 1024 - event loop has to be rewritten to
   yield sufficient performance there

[2001-01-25: sashav]
 * Side/lowbar is now appearing. Manhunt is underway for some nasty memory leak
   bug causing memory allocations of some random (very large) sizes. Added
   print_mem_stats_info to audit.c to enable output of short version of memory
   allocation status.
 * Fixed initial placement of clients; Fixed initial layer. Fixed X errors on
   initial feel load;

[2001-01-24: sashav]
 * finally got frame decoration to draw - topmost frame was never mapped.
   improved abit decor initialization code to avoid redundand calculations.
   Fixed bug in afterstep main to change desktop correctly when AS is restarted
 * updated debugging log
 * Fixed memory audition for new property reading/allocation functions :
   XListProperties, XGetTextProperty, XAllocClassHint, XAllocSizeHints; added
   LOCAL_DEBUG_CALLER_OUT macro to enable runtime caller backtracing.

[2001-01-21: sashav]
 *  implemented ASHints serialization - need to implement decerealization next.

[2001-01-18: sashav]
 * Implemeted Circulation/warping code. Some more cleanup in functions.c.

[2001-01-16: sashav]
 * Updated DeferExecution to use ASEvent and cleaned up a bit; Changed
   ExecFunction to use ASEvent - still alot to do here. Changed
   check_allowed_menu_func to use mask as an argument instead of ASWindow
   pointer. Fixed SaveOpenedWindows in afterstep.c. changed spawn_child to not
   add & at the end of cmdline if requested to not fork. Made KeyboardShortcuts
   to compile. Disabled most of the event handlers to not participate in
   compile for now. Fixed colormaps.c to use ASEvent. Added match_string_list
   to regexp.c. Added pattern2ASWindow to aswindow.c to facilitate pattern
   matching of window names.

[2001-01-12: sashav]
 * Got desktop.c to compile. Added set_desktop_num_prop and
   set_current_desk_prop to wmprops.c to facilitate updates of all those pesky
   compatibility properties on root window. Added set_client_state and
   set_client_desk in clientprops.c to enable update of the window state
   properties as per Gnome and ExtWM specs. Added change_window_state() to
   aswindow.c to provide unified interface to changing window status. Moved
   Reparent/Map/UnmapIt to aswindow.c and renamed them to be reparent_window,
   map_window, unmap_window - seems to be more consistent. Updated hints and
   clientprops to latest ExtWM specs - ICON_NAME and SKIP_PAGER added. Started
   cleaning up events.c

[2001-01-10: sashav]
 * fixed bug in hash table sorting, that was causing endless looping and
   out-of-bounds memory access

[2001-01-07: sashav]
 * implemented singleton launcher in lib/asapp. Switched background drawing and
   sound playing to use it.

[2001-01-04: sashav]
 * some more afterstep.c cleanup. Added set_as_module_socket to wmprops.c
   Removed get_virtual_root from Xmodule.c - should use wmprops now. minor
   cleanup of src/afterstep/module.c - needs way more work.
 * implemented ASWMProps strructure and some essential reading procedures.
   asproperty is gone and code is consolidated with xprop.c/.h

[2001-01-03: sashav]
 * implemented selections mechnismus. Implemented some Window Manager
   compatibility properties added property writing functions to xprop.c

[2001-01-02: sashav]
 * added forgotten xprop.c to Makefile
 * some more development in afterstep.c - spawining children is updated.
   Rearranged hints/properties in libafterstep to allow for more modular
   approach - properties on client windows are separated from the properties on
   root window. All the string code consolidated into mystring.c. Gort rid of
   CatString3 and CopyString. Implemented MakeSessionDataFile to build
   filenames of icons, etc. in ASCP.

[2000-12-28: sashav]
 * Added automated check for -V command line parameter to ASModule.c for use by
   modules

[2000-12-27: sashav]
 * completed session saving into file code - Window Maker sucks! rearranged
   CaptureAllWindows. add_window now allows to add window based on its
   WM_STATE.
 * fixed print_simple_backtrace to work around buggy gcc. Got rid of wild.c -
   moved into regexp.c

[2000-12-26: sashav]
 * Implemented show_error/warning and DEBUG_OUT/LOCAL_DEBUG_OUT. Implemented
   stack backtracing from failed X calls without signals. Converted old code in
   libasGUI to use new output routines. Compilation problem fixed related to
   removal of misc.h.

[2000-12-22: sashav]

[2000-12-21: sashav]
 * renamed ShutDown.xpm to shutdown2.xpm
 * restacking developments
 * added -fPIC

[2000-12-15: sashav]

[2000-12-14: sashav]
 * ChangeLog and configure fixed for the new version
 * Some new basic ASWindow evelopment
 * ASVector developed and tested - seems to be working just fine.
 * Removed short term memory allocation code since it is useless anyways and
   was causing some compilation problems on older compilers.
 * socket fix to make AS 1.8 work with CYGWIN under Windows NT/9x

[2000-12-13: sashav]
 * dynamic_buffer changed to ASVector with the goal to make it more general
   purpose and use in different places. Started work on ASWindowList

[2000-12-12: sashav]
 * completed transition to libasGUI. King is dead - Long Live The King
 * libasimage has been renamed to libasGUI

[2000-12-11: sashav]
 * Exposure and ConfigureNotify handling is correct now. Fixed bugs in
