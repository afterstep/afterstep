[2001-08-31: sashav]
 * Moved more size/layout management code into layout.c
 * Moved most of the layout functionality into the  libAfterBase and untied it
   from the MyWidgets Supposedly we don't really need generic MyWidgets - more
   of ready to use widgets. generic layouting and rendering has been moved out
   of it now, we pretty much get stripped down things to the level where its no
   longer usefull in its generic form.

[2001-08-30: sashav]

   babe

[2001-07-05: sashav]
 * Reimplemented image output to allow for flexible support for many image
   formats - right now it could be ASImage itself, XImage, mask XImage and 
   ARGB32. Surprisingly that simplified code quite abit. Fixed ugly bug in

[2001-06-11: owsla]

[2001-06-08: sashav]
 * configure fixes
 * rebuilt configure scripts
 * hopefully fixed main configure script to gracefully handle libraries
   configuration as well. MOved configure.h and some other headers into include
   dir, so it could be used by modules

[2001-06-07: sashav]
 * Fixed MyName requests in selfdiag.c; Added xpm.c to implement custom xpm
   handling code - appears to be rather simple and effective. Most of the
   things are implemented, except for top level routine.
 * cleaned configure script for libafterimage. added afterimage-libs script to
   print list of LD_FLAGS for linking with libafterimage

[2001-06-05: sashav]
 * fixed 50% of libAfterStep files to compile. added functions.c to hold all
   the function processing miscelanea cleaned up includes on the way.
 * Aggregated module library code into ASmodule.c  - soon to be renamed into
   module.c. readaspacket.c, Xmodule.c are now gone. Rewritten packet reading
   code to use socket_* interface from libAfterBase, with correct endiannes
   handling of the data - need to fix src/afterstep/module.c too, and maybe
   move some code from there into libAfterStep/module.c.

[2001-06-04: sashav]
 * started documenting libAfterImage
 * sorted out compilation problems, and test now builds with new libAfterImage

[2001-06-04: owsla]
 * updated the .cvsignore files

[2001-06-03: sashav]
 * got libAfterImage to compile

[2001-06-02: sashav]
 * hopefully resolved libAfterImage dependancy on libAfterBase

[2001-05-31: sashav]
 * forgot to add socket files
 * Implemented libAfterBase/socket.c to perform all the network communication
   stuff. It implements socket setup, buffered writes of int and string data,
   effective protocol implementation for non-blocking reading.
 * fixed configure scripts to correctly compile everything

[2001-05-30: sashav]
 * Prototyped ASRenderer interface
 * completed fixing old lib files to compensate for file relocation. There
   needs to be something done to Mkaefiles and configure to correctly set up
   include paths and libraries.

[2001-05-29: sashav]
 * added output.c to libAfterImage to do all the show_* stuff. added astype.h
   to define all the basic types fixed most of the files to compile
 * post relocation cleanup in process - several things merged together into
   fs.c and os.c
 * updated to reflect location change

[2001-05-28: sashav]
 * Created prototype for the new library structure - libAfterBase. There will
   be two more libraries : libAfterImage and libAfterStep. This is to split
   generic and non-generic code and allow for libraries to be used separately 
   - as a preparation for libAfterImage release as a stand-alone library.)

[2001-05-23: allanon]
 * Updated FSF snail mail address.

[2001-05-07: sashav]
 * fixed create_screen_window for InputOnly windows fixed bug in screen
   initialization where Colormap ID would get lost fixed bug in desktop
   creation code where desktop->scr would never get initialized. Added
   show_progress function to work similarly to show_warning/error Rearranged
   thresholds for output verbosity Added stdargs.h  to import.c - suggested by
   Sean Dague

[2001-04-18: sashav]
 * xcf image loading now works, but only gets you first layer with the same
   size as whole image. Need to implement layers merging for ASImages to get
   complete support for GIMP's xcf files

[2001-04-12: sashav]
 * converted asfeel, backgrounds, mywidget, and others to use ScreenInfo.
   libafterstep and libasGUI now compiles clean, althou libasGUI will need to
   be cleaned up to use ASImage for most of the stuff instead of old pixmap
   based drawing.

[2001-04-11: sashav]
 * converted mytexture.c to be multyscreen aware - althou when ASImage is done
   that will have to be switched to use ASImages instead of all the funky
   Pixmap stuff. GetColor is no longer needed, GetShadow and GetHilite moved to
   mystyles.c - get rid of lib/getcolor.c

[2001-04-10: sashav]
 * multihead support work in progress - colors are internally stored as 32bit
   ARGB values. and converted to pixels based on each screen - need to add GC
   creation code to ScreenInfo code. parse_argb_color is implemented and should
   be used instead of XParseColor.

[2001-03-22: sashav]
 * added timeouts to asetroot for displaying window; added flush_wmprops_data
   to remove specifyed properties - updated asetroot to use it. fixed rather
   nasty bug in asvector causing memory corruption in modules code; Fixed error
   handling in LoadImage

[2001-03-21: sashav]
 * Fixed module connection code to corrently use WMProps to get socket
   filename. Fixed afterstep initialization to setup modules only after WMProps
   initialized.
 * Updated asetroot to use ASWMProps for background property reading/writing.
   Added even handler to wmprops.c to handle property change events for root
   and selection windows - need to do the same for client properties as well (
   maybe?) . Added set_as_background to wmprops.c for asetroot to use. Added
   set_client_names and set_client_hints to clientprops.c for use by modules.
   Added set_text_property to facilitate conversion into UTF8 of text
   properties where needed. Added encode_atom_list to allow for easy
   translation from bitset into atom list. Updated asetroot to use new
   set_client_* functions for hints. ( it now is Extended WM specs compliant as
   needed).

[2001-03-20: sashav]
 * Fixed Cursor grabbing code to use correct cursor IDs. Fixed auditing code to
   not count memory cached in freed pool. Added destruction code for LayoutDef.
   Fixed default DecorLayouts to put things in the right places. Numerous fixes
   in LayoutDef generation code. Window decorations seems to be correct now.
   Added checks to several places in mystyles to check for non-zero pixmap
   size. There still is wierd bug in menuwindow causing X errors on menu close.
 * fixed several memory corruption bugs in myicon_create, mylook_init and
   ashash. Added flush_ashash_memory_pool to free up memory so that audit shows
   relevant data. added cleanup_mode to audit to disable invalid opointer
   reports (if needed)

[2001-03-19: sashav]
 * hmm, catching bugs in new layout code - making progress - AS now segfaults
   due to some obscure memory corruption. :)

[2001-03-13: sashav]
 * Improved owsla's fix to counter bug - xdestroyimage should not really be
   deallocating NULL memory

[2001-03-11: owsla]
 * Fixed bug that caused Total deallocs to be higher than Total allocs, this
   happened because count_find_and_extract() did not have an alternative if
   remove_hash_item() failed.
 * Added a pretty line break in spool_unfreed_mem()

[2001-03-08: sashav]
 * no message

[2001-03-06: sashav]
 * almost done with ornament layout generation code - smaller part of frame
   layout left. reverted ASHashKey back to unsigned short - when it was changed
   to unsigned int - no idea.

[2001-02-22: sashav]
 * Fixed crashing bugs in aswindow.c(restack_window()) and Xmodule.c(
   My_XErrorHandler()) Standardized titlebar resizing/respacing functions and
   now use it in both WMIcon and WMDecor. Fixed icons being black on second
   inocification - needed to resize layouts in fix_icon_size. Icon title now is
   drawn not smaller then icon itself.

[2001-02-15: sashav]
 * Completed implementation of function validation in asfeel.c; Fixed cursor
   grabbing in ExecuteComplexFunction to use actuall cursor ID instead on
   number. Supposedly got icon mapping/unmapping right this time.
   Iconification/deiconification actually works now, but fails on reentry -
   i.e. iconify->deiconify->iconify - needs some more debugging. Fixed memory
   corruption in winlist menu.

[2001-02-14: sashav]
 * playing with mywmicon and widgets. Implmented event bubbling up to higher
   level widgets if not handled by a widget. Implemented some memory
   conservation when allocating memory for MyLayourElems. Implemented memory
   preallocation caching for ASHashItem.

[2001-02-01: sashav]
 * extensive debugging of window initial mapping and subsequent withdrawal.
   Windows are now decorated and destroyed correctly. Multiple reparenting/
   messaging/destruction bugs fixed. Placement fixed when window is decorated
   after AS startup and is using USPosition. Menus needs some debugging.
 * event debugging

[2001-01-30: sashav]
 * Added mystrdup/mystrndup to memory audit code, since they are so generic;
   Fixed memory leaks in asdatabase.c(match_list), Feel.c(key binding and
   EdgeScroll), CaptureAllWindows (read_32prop_list), few other places.
   Implemented cleanup procedures for all the static data (aswindows.c,
   clientprops.c, modules.c, wmprops.c,mystyles.c); Fixed workspace session
   saving code to correctly recognize and workaround geometry. AfterSTep has no
   visible memory leaks as of now.

[2001-01-29: sashav]
 * Changed memory audit to use hash tables instead of linked list - its blazing
   fast now. Added add_hash_item to memory audit recognizeable functions -
   makes it much more usefull. Need to do the same for strdup functions.

[2001-01-28: sashav]
 * Drawing in spaces between titlebar and client is fixed - new option
   BorderColor has to be added to MyStyles. Several memory leaks fixed - in
   menus, destruction of disabled elements in mywidgets, etc.

[2001-01-26: sashav]
 * nailed down this memory corruption bug - VECTOR_TAIL was not working very
   good - forgot to multiply by unit size. Now lets fnd out with this huge
   number of pipes in linux 2.4 - 1024 - event loop has to be rewritten to
   yield sufficient performance there

[2001-01-25: sashav]
 * Side/lowbar is now appearing. Manhunt is underway for some nasty memory leak
   bug causing memory allocations of some random (very large) sizes. Added
   print_mem_stats_info to audit.c to enable output of short version of memory
   allocation status.
 * Fixed initial placement of clients; Fixed initial layer. Fixed X errors on
   initial feel load;

[2001-01-24: sashav]
 * finally got frame decoration to draw - topmost frame was never mapped.
   improved abit decor initialization code to avoid redundand calculations.
   Fixed bug in afterstep main to change desktop correctly when AS is restarted
 * updated debugging log
 * Fixed memory audition for new property reading/allocation functions :
   XListProperties, XGetTextProperty, XAllocClassHint, XAllocSizeHints; added
   LOCAL_DEBUG_CALLER_OUT macro to enable runtime caller backtracing.

[2001-01-21: sashav]
 *  implemented ASHints serialization - need to implement decerealization next.

[2001-01-18: sashav]
 * Implemeted Circulation/warping code. Some more cleanup in functions.c.

[2001-01-16: sashav]
 * Updated DeferExecution to use ASEvent and cleaned up a bit; Changed
   ExecFunction to use ASEvent - still alot to do here. Changed
   check_allowed_menu_func to use mask as an argument instead of ASWindow
   pointer. Fixed SaveOpenedWindows in afterstep.c. changed spawn_child to not
   add & at the end of cmdline if requested to not fork. Made KeyboardShortcuts
   to compile. Disabled most of the event handlers to not participate in
   compile for now. Fixed colormaps.c to use ASEvent. Added match_string_list
   to regexp.c. Added pattern2ASWindow to aswindow.c to facilitate pattern
   matching of window names.

[2001-01-12: sashav]
 * Got desktop.c to compile. Added set_desktop_num_prop and
   set_current_desk_prop to wmprops.c to facilitate updates of all those pesky
   compatibility properties on root window. Added set_client_state and
   set_client_desk in clientprops.c to enable update of the window state
   properties as per Gnome and ExtWM specs. Added change_window_state() to
   aswindow.c to provide unified interface to changing window status. Moved
   Reparent/Map/UnmapIt to aswindow.c and renamed them to be reparent_window,
   map_window, unmap_window - seems to be more consistent. Updated hints and
   clientprops to latest ExtWM specs - ICON_NAME and SKIP_PAGER added. Started
   cleaning up events.c

[2001-01-10: sashav]
 * fixed bug in hash table sorting, that was causing endless looping and
   out-of-bounds memory access

[2001-01-07: sashav]
 * implemented singleton launcher in lib/asapp. Switched background drawing and
   sound playing to use it.

[2001-01-04: sashav]
 * some more afterstep.c cleanup. Added set_as_module_socket to wmprops.c
   Removed get_virtual_root from Xmodule.c - should use wmprops now. minor
   cleanup of src/afterstep/module.c - needs way more work.
 * implemented ASWMProps strructure and some essential reading procedures.
   asproperty is gone and code is consolidated with xprop.c/.h

[2001-01-03: sashav]
 * implemented selections mechnismus. Implemented some Window Manager
   compatibility properties added property writing functions to xprop.c

[2001-01-02: sashav]
 * added forgotten xprop.c to Makefile
 * some more development in afterstep.c - spawining children is updated.
   Rearranged hints/properties in libafterstep to allow for more modular
   approach - properties on client windows are separated from the properties on
   root window. All the string code consolidated into mystring.c. Gort rid of
   CatString3 and CopyString. Implemented MakeSessionDataFile to build
   filenames of icons, etc. in ASCP.

[2000-12-28: sashav]
 * Added automated check for -V command line parameter to ASModule.c for use by
   modules

[2000-12-27: sashav]
 * completed session saving into file code - Window Maker sucks! rearranged
   CaptureAllWindows. add_window now allows to add window based on its
   WM_STATE.
 * fixed print_simple_backtrace to work around buggy gcc. Got rid of wild.c -
   moved into regexp.c

[2000-12-26: sashav]
 * Implemented show_error/warning and DEBUG_OUT/LOCAL_DEBUG_OUT. Implemented
   stack backtracing from failed X calls without signals. Converted old code in
   libasGUI to use new output routines. Compilation problem fixed related to
   removal of misc.h.

[2000-12-21: sashav]
 * restacking developments

[2000-12-14: sashav]
 * Some new basic ASWindow evelopment
 * ASVector developed and tested - seems to be working just fine.

[2000-12-13: sashav]
 * dynamic_buffer changed to ASVector with the goal to make it more general
   purpose and use in different places. Started work on ASWindowList

[2000-12-12: sashav]
 * completed transition to libasGUI. King is dead - Long Live The King

[2000-12-11: sashav]
 * Exposure and ConfigureNotify handling is correct now. Fixed bugs in
   MyLookInit and CheckPixmapCache.

[2000-12-08: sashav]

[2000-11-24: owsla]

[2000-11-23: owsla]
 * _'s fixed

[2000-11-17: sashav]
 * completely implemented new ASFeel utilization. Still needs work to implement
   autoexec execution. Got rid of all the old config reading crap

[2000-11-16: sashav]
 * Keyboard and Mouse bindings fixin. There could be several bindings for the
   same context for the single control - but with different mods. That forces
   us to alter algorithm used previously. But indeed it turned out to be more
   memory intensive, but easier to code approach.

[2000-11-13: sashav]
 * Applying ASFeel to afterstep

[2000-11-07: sashav]
 * Keyboard and Mouse bindings parsing implemented

[2000-11-02: sashav]
 * Menu Drawing completed, started menu events handler config->pixmap
   conversion part of asetroot has been moved out into libasimage ( for ASCP )
   myscandir incorporated into the dirtree.c: myscandir.c and myscandir.h
   removed.

[2000-10-31: sashav]

[2000-10-30: sashav]

 * added functions for libAsConfig to read menu from directory, standard menu,
   fixed menu. Imlemented menu loading for ASFeel added asfeel.c file to
   libafterstep Definied data structures to hold keyboard and mouse bindings
   Moved is_executable_in_path to libafterstep Hopefully fixed look/feel
   changing and different looks/feels per desktop added get_window_feel,
   get_desktop_look, get_desktop_feel functions

[2000-10-18: sashav]

[2000-10-16: sashav]
 * Implemented XImage caching using resource manager. Implemented resource
   duplication using resource manager.

[2000-10-13: sashav]
 * Implemented MyStyle storage using Hash tables - needs some  more work

[2000-10-12: sashav]
 * Added PLAY_SOUND message and function Implemented dynamically growing
   buffers and used them in module communications

[2000-10-11: sashav]

   database printing functions Added database building code into InitDatabase
   Fixed few stupid bugs in regexp compilation code.

[2000-09-21: sashav]
 * finalized Style database storage, management and matching code - added
   asdatabase to the libafterstep

[2000-09-19: sashav]

[2000-09-18: sashav]
