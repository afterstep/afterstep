 INSTALL
+-------+

Please see the INSTALL file for installation notes.

 LIBRARIES
+---------+

The following libraries are not necessarily required to run and enjoy
AfterStep however, support for them is included within AfterStep and its
various Modules.

 o  xpm		(ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/X/)
 o  jpeg	(http://www.ijg.org/)
 o  png 	(http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)

If you use a package management system (like those provided by distributions
such as RedHat, Mandrake, Debian, etc.) you will need to get the appropriate
<libname>-devel package and not the actual source code mentioned above.

 THEMES
+------+

Themes are a simple 3 1/2 step procedure:
	1/2) mkdir ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/themes
		(if it doesn't already exist    ^ )
	1) download <themename>.tar.gz into the above dir (or mv it into it)
	2) Update menu (start->Desktop->Update startmenu)
	3) Select the theme from the menu (start->Desktop->Theme->)


 HINTS
+------+

Several "looks" (theme-ish) are included with the distribution.  Any of
these can be started by selecting the name of the look from the menu.

	(startmenu)->Desktop->Looks->*

There are several "feels" (key bindings and window reactions), background
Pictures, and Animations to try out as well.  These all work the same way,
by selecting them from the menu under Desktop. But if you want to use
*different* look & feel files for *each* desktop, just tell that to
./configure.

If you wish to change or make additions to the start menu, you will need to
first create the file, either under the share tree or in a created start dir
tree in the users ~/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/start tree, then inform AfterStep
about the menu change by.

	(startmenu)->Desktop->Update startmenu

 TOOLS
+------+

AfterStep has a few tools to play with which are in the tools/ directory.
The "Uninstall-Old-AfterStep" is a script to use to remove the old binaries
of 1.3.x and 1.4.x binaries, man pages and documents.  Simply read the top
portion of this script to find the usage.  Without any options, it will only
remove the core afterstep files, leaving the apps that used to be shipped
with the releases.

 BUGS
+----+

The "bughint" file can be run when finding and reporting bugs.  Please then
open an issue on github ( https://github.com/afterstep/afterstep/issues ) and
upload this file plus any other relevant info (not a complete core file,
please!).

Both "makeasclean" and "makeaspatch" are used to clean out the source tree and
making patches to the distribution (in a proper format).

 FAQ
+----+

Now before asking any questions, be sure to read the FAQ that is included
in this distribution by clicking on the top Wharf button, or selecting
AfterStepDoc from the menu.

 TODO
+------+

In TODO/ you'll find stuff to be put in.  Feel free to add this to this version
: debug unreleased/ or unstable/.  Please also translate this README file to
your language if it hasn't been done yet.


 LOBBYING
+--------+

If you happen to run AfterStep from a Debian package on a Debian distribution,
you might want to install the "popularity-contest" package so AfterStep will be
kept as the most often installed window managers and will thus be present on
the first disks of the CD and DVD sets.  You can install the
"popularity-contest" package by entering the following command at the prompt :
apt-get install popularity-contest
