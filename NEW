1.7.126 patch 14

The ButtonPixmap, IconFont, ButtonTextureType, ButtonMaxColors, 
ButtonBgColor, and ButtonTextureColor look options are now deprecated.  
They have been replaced by several MyStyles:

ButtonPixmap           - background tile of iconified windows
ButtonTitleFocus       - title of focused iconified windows
ButtonTitleSticky      - title of sticky iconified windows
ButtonTitleUnfocus     - title of non-sticky, unfocused iconified windows

The following are automagical inheritances from old options:

FWindowStyle       => ButtonPixmap
ButtonBgColor      => ButtonPixmap.BackColor
ButtonTextureColor => ButtonPixmap.BackGradient
ButtonPixmap       => ButtonPixmap.BackPixmap
ButtonTextureType  => ButtonPixmap.texture_type
ButtonMaxColors    => ButtonPixmap.MaxColors

FWindowStyle       => ButtonTitleFocus
SWindowStyle       => ButtonTitleSticky
UWindowStyle       => ButtonTitleUnfocus

SeparateButtonTitle <flag>
                    - replaces the --enable-iconbackground configure 
                      option; specifies whether the icon title should 
                      be drawn at the top of the icon, or in a 
                      separate window at the bottom (defaults to 1)

ButtonSize <width> <height>
                    - specifies the size of iconified windows exactly; 
                      this includes titles drawn at the top, but not 
                      the separate window created by SeparateIconTitle

1.7.126 patch 11

New MyStyle option:

  BackPixmap 130 <xpm> - sets background to average of xpm and the 
                         root pixmap

  This is currently only available to AfterStep!

1.7.126 patch 09

New MyStyle option:

  BackMultiGradient <type> <color1> <offset1> ... <colorN> <offsetN>
                       - draws a multi-point gradient

  Here's an example:
  BackMultiGradient 8 black 0.0 red 0.5 green 1.0

  ... will result in a gradient like the following (b=black, r=red, g=green):

  +--------------+
  |bbbbbbbbbbbbbb|
  |bbrbbrbbrbbrbb|
  |brbrbrbrbrbrbr|
  |rrrrrrrrrrrrrr|
  |rgrgrgrgrgrgrg|
  |rrgrrgrrgrrgrr|
  |gggggggggggggg|

                         button 3; this option replaces the (mostly 
                         undocumented) NoWithdraw option
                         0 == never
                         1 == any toplevel button
                         2 == the top/bottom button (or left/right, for 
                              horizontal Wharfs) 

1.7.90 patch 11

New ascommand.pl options:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5beta5 patch21

added:
ViewportX x, ViewportY y
styles to database - allowing to do flexible StartOnPage
stuff. It will move screen to the specifyed pos on desk, before placing 
the window.

1.5beta5 patch16

configure options --with-gnustep-lib and --with-afterdir where changed
so now  you need to supply patch within gnustep dir and within gnusteplib
dir respectevely ( like --with-gnustep-lib=Library
--with-afterdir=AfterStep )

1.5beta5 patch14

Added option *PagerFastStartup to pager configuration.
This will force Pager to inform Afterstep that it is started, right 
after the first desk's background is loaded. Pager will also set the
global Atom to background Pixmap, so that Eterm can work nicely, with 
transparency emulation.
This option should speedup AS startup, when different pictures are used
for different desks.

1.5beta5 patch13 [17]

added configure option --enable-staticlibs=yes/no. Default is "yes".
This will force AS to be built with libafterstep, libasimage, libWidgets
statically linked. By default all libs are linked statically.

1.5beta5 patch10

added configure option --enable-png=yes/no. Default is "yes".
added Pager config option PagerHideInactiveLabels. See man pages.
added Pager config option PagerLabelBelowDesk. See man pages.

1.5beta4 patch07

added configure option --enable-pagerbackground=yes/no to enable/disable
all background support in Pager. Default is 'yes' (background support
enabled)

version 1.5beta4 - current
New Pager options :
defines XPM or JPEG image to be displayed in Pager window for
specified desk.
  *PagerImage  <desk#> <image_filename>

Defines image to be displayed in Root for specified desk. XPM, JPEG, or
PNG images supported internally( unless PagerXImageLoaderArgs are
specified ), other formats uses external image loader, like xli, or xv.
  *PagerDesktopImage  <desk#> <image_filename>

Defines arguments to be passed to external image loader, when showing Root
background. 
!!!!!!! This Option will disable inernal support for XPM and JPEG !!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if desk# is ommited args will have effect for all desks, but will not
disable internal JPEG and XPM support
  *PagerXImageLoaderArgs  [<desk#>] <image loader args without prog name>

When image is dislayed on root using external app this option will let
you cache image in memory, to not invoke this app every time you switch
desks, saving lots of time. This feature will not work with some user
application, specificaly KDE desktop it will also restore all icons when
you switch desks first time. Use it with care and at your own risk
  *PagerFastBackground <desk#> <yes/no> [<tile_height> [<tile_width>]]

This option will let you reduce the number of colors used for background
image, when loading JPEG or XPM internally. Implementation of this depends
on image library, therefore you not always get what you want :)
  MaxBackgroundColors <number_of_colors>

version 1.5pre6 - current
  Swallow:    (same as 1.5pre4 MaxSwallow)
  MaxSwallow: if swallowed window is larger than button size (usually 64x64),
              the button is resized to fit the swallowed window

The Size keyword specifies the size of a wharf button
<width> and <height> are non-negative integers
  *Wharf label pixmap Size <width> <height>

On the subject of button sizes, here's a brief description of how Wharf 
chooses the size of a button, in decreasing order of precedence:
  1. if the Size keyword is specified, use that
  2. if MaxSwallow is used, use the size of the swallowed window
  3. if WharfPixmap is given, use the size of the pixmap
  4. use 64x64

If swallowed Module is larger than button size (usually 64x64),
the button is resized to fit the swallowed Module [ Currently only
Pager is a feasible Swallowable Module :)]
  MaxSwallowModule

In case you haven't noticed, Wharf now supports Folders within Folders.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------
fixed options
u can enable it with --enable-fixeditems
u must have @after_share@/fixed directory and it can contain:
   feels/       - merge feels in this dir with user's local ones
   looks/       - dtto.
   backgrounds/ - dtto.
   start/       - start menu entries.

 It all works all okay with one exception - when one's using
 ordered directories (ie. 2_Applications) and in /u/s/a/f/s/ is
 Applications for example (unordered directory), those two won't get
 merged. 

#-------------------------------------------------------------------
start tree (startmenu)
Directories and/or files can now be prefixed with a <number>_, which
explicitly states their order in the menu. AS an example
~/G/L/A/s/0_My-Z-Directory
~/G/L/A/s/1_My-z-File
~/G/L/A/s/2_My-A-Directory
~/G/L/A/s/3_My-R-File
etc...
order.
Entry example:
  Exec "Name to be in startmenu" exec application &
  MiniPixmap "some-mini.xpm"
a <#>_nop file:
1) with - Nop " " - will produce a space at # point in the vertical list
2) with - Nop ""  - will produce a horizontal line at # poin in list
